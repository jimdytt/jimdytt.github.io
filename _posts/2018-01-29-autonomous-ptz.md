Q3 Q4 of 2017 were quiet in people counting terms. I was contracting as a technical PM on a project to get a pan-tilt-zoom CCTV camera to automatically detect and track targets using lidar and moving thermal sensors. Automating the camera movement to track and zoom in on moving people and cars can give the benefits of a PTZ camera without the overhead of an operator.

Interesting and technically challenging work, that project has now been delivered so it's back to counting and also to the optical  detection domain!
