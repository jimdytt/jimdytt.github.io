![Stereo Depth]({{ site.url}}/assets/content_img/colour_depth_roofs_integer_med.jpg)

First three months of 2019 were spent improving the core stereo photogrammetry disparity algorithm. This consisted of a major overhaul changing from a per block algorithm to per pixel algo. This is working in Matlab and an example of a disparity map is above. The image is false coloured so each colour change reflects a 1 pixel disparity change between the stereo pair.

The image shows a distance to a near shed roof of approx 35-40m and the large building in the background is approx 150m away and I have tested out to 800m.  Pixel accuracy is approximately 1/4 pel.

The last two months have been moving to a new image platform - a pair of  Hikvision 20MP colour camera using the SONY IMX183.
I've also been porting the Matlab code to CUDA and early results give a full 20MP depth image within a few seconds.

Next steps are to move the algorithm to consider previous frames, with a target framerate between 2-6fps.
