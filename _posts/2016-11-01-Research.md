Research is focussed on object detection with Deep Learning, tracking in video, re-identification and real-time performance. We have worked in Internet video and camera technology for many years, but have been focussed on this area since early 2014, attending CVPR2014/2015, BMVA2015 and similar.

Current research includes YOLO, Single Shot Multibox detectors and Translation aware Fully Convolutional Networks, as well as video tubelets and person re-identification. Arxiv-sanity is our friend.

Very interested in discussing approaches, especially CNN person re-identification - jimd (at) yantantethera.com
