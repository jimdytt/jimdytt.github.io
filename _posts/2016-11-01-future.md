![What does the Future hold]({{ site.url}}/assets/content_img/whats_next.jpg)


Technically, we are betting on the following :-


1. Deep Neural Nets will continue to improve at a rapid pace, Google/Facebook will share research as they have all the data
2. GPUs will continue to improve, though short term NVIDIA will remain dominant, mid term new chip architectures may make an impact
3. Camera technology, driven by mobile phones, will get better and better. 
4. Tightly controlled interaction between image sensors and software (computational photography) will become more accessible
5. The mobile phone will remain the dominant hardware and UI interaction platform
6. People will produce too much video
