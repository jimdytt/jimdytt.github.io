I have spent a lot of the year looking at depth from stereo, or photogrammetry. Inspired by <a href="https://www.elphel.com"> Elphel</a> who are using high-res commodity CMOS sensors for mid/long range depth from stereo, I've been taking a slightly different twist. Instead of using DCT matching to get sub-pixel resolution, I've been experimenting with direct block matching at the Bayer CFA pattern level.

The current set up is from taking still images from a Ricoh GR (prime lens, no low-pass filter) and then matching them. Baseline is usually 25cm. I can currently get approximately 1/4 subpixel matching off tiled 16 pixel blocks. Z accuracy is roughly 1% at 50m, 2% at 100m.

Still early days but I've started to get some results.
An example is below. Next steps are around separating out 2 surfaces on one block, then looking at possible hardware platforms
