![Counting pedestrians from video]({{ site.url}}/assets/img/people.jpg)

You upload video, we count what's in it.  Recent advances in Deep Neural Network and GPU performance mean it is now affordable to automatically count objects from generic video. 

Previously, if you were counting, you would need to use manual solutions, or specialist overhead cameras. Now we can count what's in video from mobile phones, CCTV, Gopro (tm) cameras etc.
