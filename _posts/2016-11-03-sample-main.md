![Counting pedestrians from video]({{ site.url}}/assets/img/people.jpg)

You upload video, we count what's in it.  Recent advances in Deep Neural Network and GPU performance mean it is now affordable to automatically count objects from generic video. 

Previously, if you were counting, you would need to use manual solutions, or specialist overhead cameras. Now we can use video from mobile phones, CCTV, Gopro (tm) cameras etc.

Trials will launch in January 2017, for a service which counts objects in uploaded or web video. Customers will get a dashboard with a summary and analysis of the data. There will be a low cost per video-hour for this service.

Currently we are working on counting people, cars, bicycles, horses etc., but if there is something you would like counted in your videos, get in touch - jimd (at) yantantethera.com
